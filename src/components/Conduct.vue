          <p>
            To ensure the community runs smoothly, please do your best to stick to the following rules of conduct.
            For anything not explicitly laid out in these topics, use your common sense, and treat others as you'd
            like to be treated yourself.

          <h4>Don't be a jerk</h4>
          <p>
            Be respectful and civil towards others. No harassment, trolling, and hate speech (including
            but not limited to ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, and religion).
          </p>

        <section class="rules">
          <h4>Stay on topic</h4>
          <p>
            Casual conversations are very welcome, but disruptive arguments are not. Take it to private messaging. Please
            do your best to stay within the topic of each channel.

        <section class="rules">
          <h4>No excessive advertisement, recruitment, etc</h4>
          <p>
            This isn't the place to sell your product, or run your recruitment efforts. It's OK to show
            what you've been working on, but use your common sense.
